### Movie Recommender System

**Project Description:**
The Movie Recommender System is an advanced recommendation engine designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. Utilizing collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, the system provides personalized movie recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement.

**Team and Role:**
- Team Size: 
- Role: Data Scientist

**Responsibilities:**
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gathered movie metadata, user ratings, and interaction data from various sources such as IMDb, MovieLens, and streaming services.
   - Performed data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure high-quality input for the recommendation algorithms.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted EDA using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to uncover insights and patterns in the data.
   - Visualized rating distributions, genre popularity, and user behavior to inform model selection and feature engineering.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extracted relevant features from movie metadata such as genres, directors, cast, and release year.
   - Created user profiles by aggregating viewing history and ratings, considering factors like rating frequency and recency.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Implemented collaborative filtering techniques, including user-based and item-based filtering using similarity measures like cosine and Pearson correlation.
   - Developed content-based filtering models leveraging NLP techniques to analyze movie descriptions and tags.
   - Combined collaborative and content-based methods to create a hybrid recommendation system.

5. **Algorithm Selection and Implementation:**
   - Evaluated various recommendation algorithms including matrix factorization (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and neural collaborative filtering.
   - Utilized libraries such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for model implementation and training.
   
6. **Model Evaluation and Optimization:**
   - Assessed model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and precision-recall at k.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters and employed cross-validation techniques to enhance model accuracy and generalizability.

7. **Deployment and Integration:**
   - Developed a user-friendly web interface for movie recommendations using Flask and React.
   - Integrated the recommendation system into the interface, ensuring seamless interaction and real-time updates.
   - Utilized Docker for containerization and AWS for cloud deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability.

8. **Collaboration and Reporting:**
   - Worked closely with frontend developers, UX/UI designers, and stakeholders to align the system with user needs and business objectives.
   - Provided detailed reports and visualizations to stakeholders, highlighting system performance, user engagement metrics, and areas for improvement.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
- Libraries and Frameworks: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, React
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Database Management: MySQL, MongoDB
- Deployment: Docker, AWS

**Outcome:**
The Movie Recommender System successfully delivered highly personalized movie recommendations, significantly enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. The system demonstrated robust performance, scalability, and adaptability to diverse user preferences, positioning it as a valuable asset for the organization.
